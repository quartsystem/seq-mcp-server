# üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you resolve common issues with SEQ MCP Server.

## üö® Quick Fixes

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: "Cannot connect to SEQ server"

**Solutions**:
1. **Check your SEQ server URL**
   ```bash
   # Verify the URL is correct and accessible
   curl -I https://your-seq-server.com
   ```

2. **Verify network connectivity**
   ```bash
   # Test if you can reach the server
   ping your-seq-server.com
   ```

3. **Check firewall settings**
   - Ensure port 443 (HTTPS) or 80 (HTTP) is open
   - Check if your firewall blocks outbound connections

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: "Authentication failed" or "Invalid API key"

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify your API key**
   - Check if the key is correct in your configuration
   - Ensure the key hasn't expired
   - Test the key directly with SEQ API

2. **Check API key permissions**
   - Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions
   - Contact your SEQ administrator if needed

### Installation Issues

**Problem**: "Command not found" or installation fails

**Solutions**:
1. **Check .NET installation**
   ```bash
   dotnet --version
   # Should show .NET 9.0 or later
   ```

2. **Reinstall the tool**
   ```bash
   dotnet tool uninstall -g QuartSystem.SeqMcpServer
   dotnet tool install -g QuartSystem.SeqMcpServer
   ```

3. **Check PATH environment**
   - Ensure .NET tools directory is in your PATH
   - Restart your terminal/command prompt

## üîç Common Error Messages

### "License expired"

**What it means**: Your trial or license has expired.

**Solution**: Request a free license by emailing [support@quartsystem.com](mailto:support@quartsystem.com) with your Machine ID.

### "Machine ID mismatch"

**What it means**: Your license is tied to a different machine.

**Solution**: Contact support to transfer your license to the current machine.

### "Query timeout"

**What it means**: Your query took too long to execute.

**Solutions**:
1. **Reduce time range**
   - Use shorter time periods
   - Try "last hour" instead of "last week"

2. **Add filters**
   - Filter by specific applications
   - Use more specific search terms

3. **Reduce result count**
   - Limit results to smaller numbers
   - Use pagination for large datasets

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**What it means**: You've made too many requests too quickly.

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait a few minutes** before trying again
2. **Reduce query frequency**
3. **Contact support** if you need higher limits

### "Invalid query syntax"

**What it means**: Your search query has syntax errors.

**Solutions**:
1. **Simplify your query**
   - Start with basic searches
   - Add complexity gradually

2. **Check query examples**
   - Review our [Query Examples](user-guide.md#-query-examples)
   - Use the query builder tool

## üîß Configuration Issues

### MCP Client Not Detecting SEQ MCP Server

**Problem**: Your MCP client doesn't recognize the SEQ MCP Server.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check configuration file**
   ```json
   {
      "mcpServers": {
         "seq-net": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "seq-mcp",
            "env": {
               "Seq__BaseUrl": "https://your-seq-server:5341",
               "Seq__ApiKey": "your-api-key-here"
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

2. **Verify command path**
   ```bash
   which seq-mcp
   # Should show the path to the installed tool
   ```

3. **Restart MCP client**
   - Close and reopen your MCP client
   - Check client logs for error messages

### Configuration Not Loading

**Problem**: Your configuration settings aren't being applied.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check file location**
   - Ensure config file is in the correct location
   - Verify file permissions

2. **Validate JSON syntax**
   - Use a JSON validator to check syntax
   - Ensure proper escaping of special characters

3. **Check environment variables**
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Restart your terminal after setting variables

## üìä Performance Issues

### Slow Queries

**Problem**: Queries take too long to execute.

**Solutions**:
1. **Optimize time ranges**
   - Use shorter time periods
   - Start with recent data

2. **Add specific filters**
   - Filter by application or service
   - Use exact matches when possible

3. **Use aggregation**
   - Group results instead of returning raw data
   - Use count/sum operations for large datasets

### High Memory Usage

**Problem**: SEQ MCP Server uses too much memory.

**Solutions**:
1. **Reduce result limits**
   - Set lower max-results values
   - Use pagination for large datasets

2. **Optimize queries**
   - Use more specific searches
   - Avoid very broad time ranges
