## üìß Requesting a License

### Free License Program

**Currently, all licenses are provided FREE of charge** while QuartSystem establishes its fiscal position. This includes:

- ‚úÖ **Personal licenses** - FREE
- ‚úÖ **Commercial licenses** - FREE  
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise licenses** - FREE
- ‚úÖ **License renewals** - FREE

### How to Request a License

1. **Get Your Machine ID**
   
   Run this command to get your machine ID:
   ```bash
   seq-mcp machine-id
   ```
   
   This will output something like:
   ```
   Machine ID:
   ABC123...XYZ==
   
   Strength: Strong
   ```

2. **Send License Request Email**
   
   Send an email to: [support@quartsystem.com](mailto:support@quartsystem.com)
   
   **Subject**: "SEQ MCP Server License Request"
   
   **Include in your email**:
   - Your **Machine ID** (from step 1)
   - Your **name and email address**
   - **License type needed** (Personal/Commercial/Enterprise)
   - **Intended use** (brief description of how you'll use the tool)
   
   Example email:
   ```
   Subject: SEQ MCP Server License Request
   
   Hello,
   
   I would like to request a free license for SEQ MCP Server.
   
   Machine ID: ABC123...XYZ==
   Name: John Doe
   Email: john.doe@example.com
   License Type: Commercial
   Use Case: Log analysis for our development team
   
   Thank you!
   ```

3. **Receive Your License**
   
   You'll receive your license key via email within 24-48 hours.

4. **Activate License** (see [Installing a License](#installing-a-license))

### üÜï Automatic License Activation

When you request a license, you may receive an activation script along with your license key. This script automatically activates your license for you.

**If you receive an activation script:**

1. **Save the script file** (e.g., `LicenseActivation365.bat` or `LicenseActivation365.sh`)
2. **Execute the script** to automatically activate your license:
   - **Windows:** Double-click the `.bat` file or run it from command line
   - **Linux/macOS:** Run `chmod +x LicenseActivation365.sh && ./LicenseActivation365.sh`
3. **Verify activation** with `seq-mcp license-status`

**If you only receive a license key:** Use the manual activation methods described below.

### License Renewals

When your license expires, simply send a renewal request to the same email address with:
- Your Machine ID
- Your previous license information
- Confirmation that you still need the license

**All renewals are currently FREE** until QuartSystem establishes its fiscal position.

## üì• Installing a License

Once you receive your license key via email, install it using the `activate` command:

```

### Installation Steps

1. **Run the activate command** with your license key

## üîç License Management

### Check Your License Status

```

This will display detailed information about your license:

**For Trial Licenses:**
```

Status: üü° Trial
Type: trial
Trial Started: 2025-01-15 10:30:00 UTC

üõí To request a free license:
1. Get your machine ID: seq-mcp machine-id
2. Email: support@quartsystem.com
```

### Understanding License Status

- **üü° Trial**: You're using the 30-day trial period
- **‚úÖ Licensed**: You have a valid commercial license
- **‚ùå No Valid License**: Trial expired or license invalid

### License File Location

- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\.seq-mcp\license.json`
  - Example: `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\.seq-mcp\license.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.seq-mcp/license.json`
- **macOS**: `~/.seq-mcp/license.json`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "License file not found"

**Cause:** The file path provided doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Check the file path is correct
- Use absolute paths if relative paths don't work
- Ensure the file exists: `ls -la license.json` (Linux/Mac) or `dir license.json` (Windows)

### "License file is empty or invalid"

**Cause:** The file doesn't contain valid license data

**Solution:**
- Ensure the file contains either:
  - A valid JWT token (starts with `eyJ`)
  - A JSON object with `licenseKey` property
- Check file permissions allow reading
- Verify the file isn't corrupted

### "Error reading license file"

**Cause:** File system or permission issues

**Solution:**
- Check file permissions: `chmod 644 license.json` (Linux/Mac)
- Ensure the file isn't locked by another process
- Try copying the file to a different location

### "License file has been tampered with"

**Cause:** The trial file has been modified or corrupted

**Solution:**
- Delete the license file and restart the application to start a new trial
- **Windows:** Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\.seq-mcp\license.json`
- **Linux/Mac:** Delete `~/.seq-mcp/license.json`

### "Invalid license: Signature validation failed"

**Cause:** Public/private key mismatch

**Solution:** 
- Ensure the public key in `LicenseKeys.cs` matches the private key used to generate the JWT
- Rebuild and reinstall the tool after updating the public key

### "License is bound to a different machine"

**Cause:** Machine ID doesn't match

**Solution:**
- Get the correct Machine ID from your system using `seq-mcp machine-id`
- Request a new license with the correct Machine ID
- Check license status with `seq-mcp license-status` to verify the fix

### "License has expired"

**Cause:** JWT expiration date passed

**Solution:**
- Request a license renewal by emailing [support@quartsystem.com](mailto:support@quartsystem.com)
- Include your Machine ID and previous license information
- Check license status with `seq-mcp license-status` to confirm expiration

### Trial starts even with existing license

**Cause:** License file format incorrect

**Solution:**
- Check `license.json` format matches exactly
- Ensure `licenseKey` field is present and contains valid JWT
