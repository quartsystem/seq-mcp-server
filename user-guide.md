# üìñ User Guide

Welcome to SEQ MCP Server! This guide will help you get the most out of your SEQ log analysis experience.

## üéØ What is SEQ MCP Server?

SEQ MCP Server is a professional tool that connects your AI assistant to your SEQ log server, enabling powerful log analysis, querying, and filtering through natural language conversations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Basic Setup

After [quick start setup](quick-start.md), you can immediately start asking your AI assistant questions about your logs:

```
"Show me all errors from the last 24 hours"
```

### 2. Understanding the Tools

SEQ MCP Server provides several specialized tools for different types of log analysis:

| Tool | Purpose | Example Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `seq.search` | Find specific events | "Show me all login failures" |
| `seq.tabulate` | Aggregate analysis | "Count errors by application" |
| `seq.analyze` | Complete analysis | "Analyze performance issues" |
| `seq.health` | Check connection | "Is my SEQ server healthy?" |

## üîç Core Features

### Search and Filter

The most common use case is searching for specific events:

```
"Find all errors containing 'timeout' in the last week"
"Show me logs from the 'web-api' application"
"Display authentication failures for user 'john.doe'"
```

### Aggregation and Analysis

Get insights from your logs with aggregation queries:

```
"Count errors by hour for the last 24 hours"
"Group logs by application and show the top 10"
"Show average response times by endpoint"
```

### Time-based Queries

Work with time ranges effectively:

```
"Show me logs from yesterday"
"Compare this week's errors with last week"
"Find patterns in the last 30 days"
```

## üìä Advanced Features

### Multi-Window Analysis

Compare different time periods:

```
"Compare error rates between this week and last week"
"Show me performance trends across multiple time windows"
```

### Intelligent Analysis

Get comprehensive insights:

```
"Analyze the performance issues we had yesterday"
"Give me an overview of all errors this month"
"Investigate the spike in login failures"
```

### Smart Suggestions

The system provides intelligent suggestions:

```
"What should I investigate based on recent errors?"
"Suggest queries to analyze application performance"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

### 1. Start Specific, Then Broaden

Begin with specific queries and expand as needed:

```
‚ùå "Show me everything"
‚úÖ "Show me errors from the API service in the last hour"
```

### 2. Use Time Ranges Effectively

Be specific about time periods:

```
‚ùå "Show me recent errors"
‚úÖ "Show me errors from the last 2 hours"
```

### 3. Combine Search with Analysis

Get both raw data and insights:

```
"Find all timeout errors and analyze their patterns"
"Show me authentication failures and group them by user"
```

### 4. Use Filters Wisely

Narrow down results with specific filters:

```
"Show me errors from production environment only"
"Find logs with severity 'Error' or 'Critical'"
```

## üìà Common Use Cases

### Application Monitoring

```
"Monitor my web application for errors"
"Show me performance metrics for the API"
"Alert me to unusual activity patterns"
```

### Security Analysis

```
"Find all failed authentication attempts"
"Show me suspicious login patterns"
"Analyze access patterns for admin users"
```

### Performance Analysis

```
"Identify slow database queries"
"Show me response time trends"
"Find performance bottlenecks"
```

### Troubleshooting

```
"Investigate the outage from yesterday"
"Find the root cause of the memory leak"
"Analyze the spike in error rates"
```

## üîß Configuration Tips

### Optimize Performance

- Use specific time ranges to limit data
- Apply filters to reduce result sets
- Use aggregation for large datasets

### Security Best Practices

- Use API keys for authentication
- Limit access to necessary log data
- Monitor your usage patterns

### Error Handling

The system provides helpful error messages:

- **Connection issues**: Check your SEQ server URL and network
- **Authentication errors**: Verify your API key
- **Query errors**: Review your search parameters
