# üîí Security Guide

SEQ MCP Server is designed with security as a top priority. This guide covers security best practices and important security considerations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **API Key Support**: Secure authentication with SEQ servers
- **TLS Encryption**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and excessive usage
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs

### Data Protection
- **PII Redaction**: Automatic redaction of sensitive information
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage of configuration and license data
- **Memory Management**: Secure handling of sensitive data in memory

### Network Security
- **Certificate Validation**: Proper SSL/TLS certificate verification
- **Connection Timeouts**: Protection against hanging connections
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak information

## üîê Security Best Practices

### 1. Use Strong Authentication

**Enable API Key Authentication**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "seq-net": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "seq-mcp",
        "env": {
            "Seq__BaseUrl": "https://your-seq-server:5341",
            "Seq__ApiKey": "your-api-key-here"
        }
      }
  }
}
```

**Best Practices**:
- ‚úÖ Use strong, unique API keys
- ‚úÖ Rotate API keys regularly
- ‚úÖ Store API keys securely (environment variables, not in config files)
- ‚ùå Never share API keys
- ‚ùå Never commit API keys to version control

### 2. Secure Configuration

**Environment Variables** (Recommended):
```bash
export SEQ_API_KEY="your-secure-api-key"
export SEQ_URL="https://your-seq-server.com"
```

### 3. Network Security

**Use HTTPS**:
- Always use HTTPS for SEQ server connections
- Verify SSL certificates
- Use internal networks when possible

**Firewall Configuration**:
- Restrict outbound connections to necessary ports only
- Use VPN for remote access when needed
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

### 4. Access Control

**Principle of Least Privilege**:
- Grant minimal necessary permissions to API keys
- Use read-only access when possible
- Regularly review and audit permissions

**User Access**:
- Limit access to authorized personnel only
- Use strong passwords for user accounts
- Enable multi-factor authentication where possible

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Security Issue

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Disable affected API keys
   - Check audit logs for suspicious activity
   - Change passwords if necessary
   - Contact your security team

2. **Investigation**:
   - Preserve logs and evidence
   - Document the incident
   - Identify the scope of impact
   - Determine root cause

3. **Recovery**:
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Update configurations
   - Monitor for continued issues
   - Review and update security procedures
